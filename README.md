Improving the Quality of Respiratory Signals Extracted from the Segmented Mask Area


This repository shows the method and model weights for segmenting mask area in thermal images. It also presents the method for calculating the respiratory rate and the results for all experiments performed in the work.


The code and appropriate test files will be made available after acceptance and revision of the article.
